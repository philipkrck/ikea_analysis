# Theoretical Background & Research Question 

## Data Set
\textcolor{gray}{by P. Krück}
The data set was obtained by a kaggle.com user (Reem Abdulrahman) by the means of webscraping techniques from the Saudi Arabian Ikea website in the furniture category on the 20th of April 2020. Noteworthy features include the name, category, price in Saudi Riyals, the designer and dimensions (width, height and depth). The data set has 13 variables and 2962 distinct observations after removing duplicates.

## Theoretical Background {#theoretical_background}

### Random Forest Basics
\textcolor{gray}{by J. Pein}

In order to analyze the feature importance in relation to the price variable, a random forest regression model was chosen. A random forest consists of many decision trees, which make a prediction based on a majority decision process. In standard decision trees, each nodes is split to achieve the best performing model. In random forests however, the nodes are randomly split. Compared to linear regression models, the random forests model not only takes into account the mean and covariance structure of response, but also deeper deeper aspects of data [@Groemping2009] resulting in a more advanced and robust model. 

### Feature Importance
\textcolor{gray}{by J. Pein}

- feature and predictor variable can be used interchangibly

## Research Question {#research_question}
\textcolor{gray}{by P. Krück}
This paper explores the influence for different variables on the price in the given data set. The motivating forces for this research question are the possible implications for price determination of new items.
