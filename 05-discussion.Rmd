# Discussion {#discussion}
\hfill\textcolor{gray}{by J. Pein}

In this chapter, the results are discussed in connection with the research question. The question that the results were supposed to answer is the following:

*How important are the different features of Ikea products in regard to their price?*

## Feature Importance

The `size_m3` variable is the most important feature. Probably the main reason for this is the size of a product being closely linked to its material cost. Big items are generally more costly to produce, thus leading to a higher selling price and vice versa. Due to the high correlation to the price variable described in section \@ref(collinearity) and section \@ref(relationship), it is worth discussing in future research whether or not to include this variable in a possible predictive analysis model . 

The `designer` variable is the second most important feature. When looking at the price distribution per designer, in can be clearly seen that the interquartile range (IQR) of price varies for each designer. In addition, the IQR often is smaller than 300â‚¬, thus showing a tendency towards a certain price range, which might be the reason for the relatively high feature importance of the designer variable. For the plot, see figure \@ref(fig:price-dist-per-designer).

The `name` variable includes around 50 different product names with partly small numbers of occurences. But, as can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:homogeneity), certain product lines (names) tend to be more expensive than others. *LIDTHULT*, for example, is the most expensive product line in each of the categories *beds*, *chairs* and *sofas & armchairs* while *HEMNES* is on the lower end of the price scale. This behavior explains a relatively high feature importance of the `name` variable.

`Category` is another feature with a relatively high importance. One reason for this is the different category's price distributions showing a clear tendency towards certain price segments (see figure \@ref(fig:price-dist-per-category)), i.e. wardrobes and beds are generally more expensive than chairs.

The feature importance of `other_colors` is the second lowest, but still considerable. This still relatively high feature importance might be due to the difference of the mean price and the relatively small IQR (see: figure \@ref(fig:price-dist-other-colors)). On the other hand, there is a large overlapping area within the IQR in the two expressions of `other_colors` possibly reducing the feature importance.

The very low feature importance of the `sellable_online` variable is probably because the low number of occurences of a product being sellable online. Only around 0.6% of the products are sellable online.

## Conclusion

The data used in this paper was scraped from the Saudi Arabian Ikea website, thus this analysis mainly focusses on Ikea products in the Saudi Arabian market. To analyze the geographically independent feature importances, more data should be scraped from other international Ikea websites. The research question of this paper, *How important are the different features of Ikea products in regard to their price?*, could thus not be answered for the global Ikea product market, but for the Saudi Arabian market only.

Also, in further research, the results presented on the feature importance of the predictor variables on the response variable price should be validated by other techniques than the random forest model used in this analysis to achieve unbiased results. 

Furthermore, based on this analysis a predictive model could be developed which predicts the price of Ikea products in the Saudi Arabian Market based on the features analyzed. This could be used by Ikea internally to analyze if the price of their new product aligns with the prices of the currently available product or by market researchers. 

Lastly, the authors were surprised by the high feature importances of the variables `designer` and `name` computed by the random forest model. Both variables have lots different values, suggesting an overfitting of the random forest model. This, however, is objected by scientific research [@Breiman2001, p.29].
Exploring what the reason behind the high feature importances of the variables `designer` and `name` and if they are due to overfitting of a random forest model should be analyzed in future research. 
If the high feature importance of the variables truly is not due to overfitting, this example backs up the thesis of @Groemping2009[p.317] that random forests are able to discover deeper patterns in the data. These patterns are beyond the discussion applied here, showing the power of random forests models.
