% John tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the various options.  Remember
% that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% CHOOSE PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one will format for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{templates/ociamthesis}
% This one will format for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but

The data set was obtained by a kaggle.com user (Reem Abdulrahman) by the means of webscraping techniques from the Saudi Arabian Ikea website in the furniture category on the 20th of April 2020. Noteworthy features include the name, category, price in Saudi Riyals, the designer and dimensions (width, height and depth). The data set has 13 variables and 2962 observations.

\hypertarget{rf-basics}{%
\subsection{RF Basics}\label{rf-basics}}

In order to analyze the feature importance in relation to the price variable, a random forest regression model was chosen. A random forest consists of many decision trees, which make a prediction based on a majority decision process. In standard decision trees, each nodes is split to achieve the best performing model. In random forests however, the nodes are randomly split. Compared to linear regression models, the random forests model not only takes into account the mean and covariance structure of response, but also deeper deeper aspects of data\footnote{Grömping, ``Variable Importance Assessment in Regression: Linear Regression versus Random Forest.''} leading to a more advanced and robust model.

\section{Data Cleaning and Transformatoin}\label{datacleaning}}

To examine our data set properly, we first had to restructure and reformat it. This initial data cleaning step included type conversions, value mutation, addition of new calculated fields and the dropping of irrelevant columns.
Concretely, we converted name, category and designer to categorical variables. In the designer column, we converted blank strings and values prefixed by ``IKEA of Sweden'' to missing values (\texttt{NA}). Furthermore, we converted both the price and old price to double values and changed the currency from Saudi Arabian Riyals to Euros based on the exchange rate from the time the data set was obtained by the author @ref(\#theoretical\_background). To better facilitate the comparison of the different sizes of furniture items, we calcuted the size in cubic meters based on the depth, width and height values.
Finally, we selected only columns that could have a potential impact in our analysis (see Table \ref{tab:initial-ikea} and \ref{tab:tidy-ikea}).

tidy category -\textgreater{} duplicate filtering
- there were some observations with the same item id. All other value were the same in these instances except for the category.
- The authors considered multiple approaches to handle these data duplications
- Option one -\textgreater{} mutate duplicates into one combination of categories (e.g.~a and b to a, b), then the newly created categories would have a low count of observations while the single categories would have a decreased count. We would then have an increased count in categories. Because the count of the individual categories is low, no definite conclusion can be drawn for the interaction on the price
- Option two -\textgreater{} create multiple variables for each observed category for the same item id. The authors wanted to analyze the feature importance of category variable as such and not the multiple occurrences of the category variable
- The authors chose option of selecting the observations where the category count occurred most frequent.

\hypertarget{rf}{%
\section{Random Forest Regression Model}\label{rf}}

This analysis was conducted using the R randomForest package, which is based on the original Breiman and Cutler's Fortran code for random forest regression. To learn more about how random forests work or the randomForest package, see Liaw and Wiener\footnote{``Classification and Regression by randomForest.''} or \#chapter2 \#TODO. To reproduce the analysis conducted in this paper, the prepatory steps are described now. The following steps are based on an already cleaned ikea data frame which is described in \ref{datacleaning}. This data frame is then transformed further to be used with the randomForest package.
First, the variable \texttt{old\_price\_eur} is removed from the data frame, due to a very high correlation and relationship to the price variable analyzed in \ref{collinearity} and \ref{relationship} Then, the designers and names, which are not part of the 50 \texttt{designers} and 49 \texttt{names} with the highest number of occurences, are grouped in the \texttt{other} value. This is because the \texttt{randomForest} method does not allow categorical variables with more than 53 predictors. The last step is dealing with the missing values in the data. As described in \ref{zeros}, there are missing values in the \texttt{size\_m3} and \texttt{designer} variables. To use the \texttt{randomForest} method of the randomForest package on the data, those missing values are dealt with using three different approaches. In the first approach the rows with missing values are deleted, reducing the total number of rows by aproximately 50\%. In the second approach the missing values are dummy coded with a value of -1000. The third approach uses the \texttt{na.roughfix\ =\ na.omit} argument, which is the built in way of the randomForest package to deal with missing values.
After preparing the data, the \texttt{randomForest} method of the randomForest package is applied to the data with number of trees set to 2000 and importance set to \texttt{TRUE}.

\texttt{randomForest(price\_eur\ \textasciitilde{}\ .,\ rf\_ikea,\ ntree=2000,\ keep.forest=FALSE,\ importance=TRUE)}

Then the \texttt{importance} method of the randomForest package is used to save the feature importances, which are computed by permuting feature importance, which is described in \#chapter2 \#TODO. The three different approaches of dealing with the missing values in the data set lead to different results, so the authors chose to calculate the mean result of the three approaches. The result of this analysis is presented in the following chapter.

\section{TODO: set n\_trees to 2000 before handing in}\label{todo-set-n_trees-to-2000-before-handing-in}}

In this chapter, the results of the analysis of the feature importance of different predictor variables (features) on the response variable price of Ikea products are presented.

As described in \ref{rf}, the feature importance was calculated using permuting feature importance of the randomForest R package. In this analysis, feature importance is derived from the percentage increase of the mean squared error (MSE) of the overall random forest regression model with the response variable \texttt{price\_eur}. When the percentage increase of the MSE is higher, the feature is more important, accordingly, when the percentage increase of the MSE is lower, the feature is less important.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1} \caption{A nice image.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-5}
\end{figure}

Thus, as can be seen in the figure above, the most important feature is \texttt{size\_m3} with an increase of the MSE of 182\%. The second, third and fourth most important features are \texttt{designer} with an increase of 120\%, \texttt{name} with an increase of 114\% and \texttt{category} with an increase of 105\%. The fifth most important feature is \texttt{other\_colors} with an increase of the MSE of 78\% and the least important feature is \texttt{sellable\_online} with a 9\% increase.

These results are further discussed in the following section.
