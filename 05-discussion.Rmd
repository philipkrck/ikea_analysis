# Discussion {#discussion}

In this chapter, the results are discussed in connection with the research question. The question that the results were supposed to answer is the following:

*How important are the different features of Ikea products in regard to their price?*

## Feature Importance

The `size_m3` variable is the most important feature. Probably the main reason for this is that the size of a product is closely linked to its material cost. Big items are generally more costly to produce, thus leading to a higher selling price and vice versa. Due to the high correlation to the price variable described in \@ref(collinearity) and \@ref(relationship), it is worth discussing where or not to include this variable in a possible predictive analysis model. 

The `designer` variable is the second most important feature. It might seem, that this is due to *overfitting*, since the random forest regression model takes into account around 50 different combinations of designers, partly with a low number of occurences. But according to @Groemping2009 random forest models are relatively robust against overfitting. Further research should be conducted to analyze whether overfitting is present or not.
When looking at the price distribution per designer, in can be clearly seen that the interquartile range (IQR) of price varies for each designer. In addition, the IQR often is smaller than 300â‚¬, thus showing a tendency towards a certain price range, which might be the reason for the relatively high feature importance of the designer variable. The plot \@ref(price_distribution_designer) is available in the appendix.
The random forest regression model includes around 50 different product names with partly small numbers of occurences. Thus, the relatively high feature importance of the `name` variable might also be caused by overfitting. As discussed above, further research should be conducted to analyze whether this is the case.

`Category` is another feature with a relatively high importance. This is because the different category's price distributions show a clear tendency towards certain price segments \@ref(price_distribution_category), i.e. Wardrobes and beds are generally more expensive than chairs.
To the authors it seems counterintuitive that `designer` and `name` have higher feature importances than the `category` feature, because the IQR in the price distribution per category is often a lot smaller than the IQR of the designer and name price distributions. This also hints towards overfitting of the name and designer variables. However, in the categories with the most occurrences, namely `Wardrobes`, `Sofas & armchairs` and `Beds`, the IQR is relatively large and there are many overlapping prices ranges for different categories, which explains a lower feature importance.

The feature importance of `other_colors` is the second lowest, but still considerable. This still relatively high feature importance might be due to the difference of the mean price and the relatively small IQR \@ref(price_distribution_other_colors). On the other hand, there is a large overlapping area within the IQR in the two expressions of `other_colors` possibly reducing the feature importance.

The very low feature importance of the `sellable_online` variable is mainly because the low number of occurences of a product being sellable online. Only around 0.6% of the products are sellable online.

## Conclusion & Outlook

general results might contain bias or variance errors, further investigating

- Further research:
    - analyze designer overfitting, recommend using overfitting techniques (e.g. ...)
    - analyze same research question with other techniques (lm, name more) and compare
    - data scraping from other country-pages
    
    
show practical usefulness ! ! !! !
