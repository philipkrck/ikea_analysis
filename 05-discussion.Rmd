# Discussion {#discussion}

## size_m3

- material cost
- big items more expensive than small ones
- high correlation to price


## designer

- designers with high number of products produce products in wide price range : plot reference -> appendix

- many different combinations of designer (49-53)
- many designer-combinations with low number of products:
  - n combinations with occurrences<5

-> overfitting: cite scholarly article
-> low generalization : model might perfom bad on other data

## name

- overfitting

## category

- beds are more expensive than chairs : some categories are more expensive than others (show plot)
- but, price range varies heavily in category (show plot)

## other_colors

- products of every price range have both options : low importance
- mean price is higher if other_colors is true (show plot covariance price+other_colors)
- interquartile-range is smaller if other_colors is false

## sellable_online

sellable true: price range too high
sellable ntrue: very rare

## Conclusion & Ausblick

- Further research:
    - analyze designer overfitting, recommend using overfitting techniques (e.g. ...)
    - analyze same research question with other techniques (lm, name more) and compare
    - data scraping from other country-pages
